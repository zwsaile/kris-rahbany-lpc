                My clinical experience includes working with families and adopted children, at the Evergreen Psychotherapy Center facilitating two - week intensive family therapy and as a milieu behavioral counselor at EDCare Denver where I structured daily activities and facilitated group therapy with patients seeking recovery from eating disorders. Post graduation, I spent some time providing individual and couples therapy in private practice, with various presenting concerns including depression, grief anxiety, and eating disorders. Prior to opening my own private practice, I worked as a primary therapist at the Eating Recovery Center, serving patients and their families, at the inpatient and partially hospitalized levels of care.
